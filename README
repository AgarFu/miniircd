miniircd -- A (very) simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server
------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

    miniircd is a small and limited IRC server. Yet, it's a functional
    alternative to a full-blown ircd if you want to run a small IRC
    server for private or internal usage.

    Features:

      * Knows about the basic IRC protocol and commands.
      * Easy installation.
      * No configuration.
      * No ident lookup (so that people behind firewalls that filter
        the ident port without sending NACK can connect without long
        timeouts).

    Limitations:

      * Can't connect to other IRC servers.
      * Only knows the most basic IRC commands.
      * No IRC operators.
      * No channel operators.
      * No user or channel modes.
      * No reverse DNS lookup.
      * No other mechanism to reject clients than requiring a password.

Requirements:

    Python 2.3 or newer. Get it at http://www.python.org.

Installation:

    None. Just run "./miniircd --help" (or "python miniircd --help")
    to get some help.
